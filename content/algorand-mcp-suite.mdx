We just shipped **Algorand MCP Suite v0.1.1** – a release that bundles a production-ready Model Context Protocol server with a polished Raycast extension. The goal is simple: give AI agents *and* humans first-class access to Algorand accounts, assets, swaps, and docs from one codebase.

## 🎯 What's inside the suite?

### 🤖 MCP Server (55+ tools)

- **Basic utilities**: echo, calculate, get current time, and fund testnet wallets.
- **Core Algorand ops**: account generation, payments, ASA creation, transfers, transaction lookup.
- **Swap workflow**: five new tools powered by the Pera Swap SDK with multi-DEX aggregation.
- **Utility & API access**: encoding helpers, TEAL compile/disassemble, Algod & Indexer calls, NFD lookups.
- **Advanced transactions**: atomic groups, smart-contract lifecycle, participation keys, ARC-26 QR flows.
- **Knowledge search**: semantic lookup across Algorand documentation.

### ⚡ Raycast Extension

- Wallet inventory, balance refresh, testnet faucet, and secure export in the menu bar.
- Send ALGO, transfer ASAs, create assets, and inspect assets without touching a terminal.
- Real-time swap quotes with price impact, slippage control, and AlgoExplorer deep links.
- Keyboard-first quick actions (`⌘S`, `⌘X`, `⌘T`, etc.) plus toast feedback for every interaction.

## 🔐 Built with security in mind

- AES-256-GCM encryption keeps mnemonic phrases off the filesystem in plaintext.
- Environment-based network selection defaults to **testnet** but can be promoted to mainnet instantly.
- Zod validation sits in front of every tool so malformed payloads never hit Algorand RPCs.
- Sensitive data is never logged, and wallet memory is scrubbed right after use.

## 🏗️ Architecture snapshot

```
src/
├─ index.ts                  # MCP host + router
├─ algorand.ts               # Core blockchain operations
├─ utilityTools.ts           # Validation, TEAL compile/disassemble, cryptography
├─ apiTools.ts               # Algod, Indexer, NFD integrations
├─ advancedTransactionTools.ts
├─ arc26Tools.ts
└─ knowledgeTools.ts         # Semantic doc search
```

The Raycast folder (`raycast/algorand`) mirrors the same services, so adding a capability to one surface usually unlocks it for both.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure the environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # then set ALGORAND_NETWORK, ALGOD + Indexer URLs, API tokens, and optional Qdrant/OpenAI keys
   ```
3. **Build & run**
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm start
   ```
4. **Wire up your client**
   - VS Code MCP extension, Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, or any MCP-compatible agent.
   - Point the client at `dist/index.js` and drop your Algorand credentials in the `env` block.

## 🧪 Testing + demos

- `npm run dev` for auto rebuilds during tool development.
- `npm test` to exercise the toolchain plus manual scenarios listed in `TEST_QUERIES.md`.

## 💡 Why this matters

> “Being able to call Algorand swaps, docs search, and wallet management directly from my AI assistant cut my prototyping time in half.” – Early Raycast tester

If you're building Algorand experiences, this release means:

- **One server, every workflow** – from faucet funding to atomic swaps.
- **One Raycast command palette** – for humans who prefer hotkeys over scripts.
- **Shared security + config** – no more copy/pasting mnemonics across tools.

Clone it, configure it, and ship faster on Algorand. 🛠️
